# Regression Tests

Use `run-e2e-regression` label to run regression tests on demand.

## Smoke vs Regression

In practice, everything what is not a "happy path" functional system-tests (i.e. edge cases, negative conditions) should go to a `regression` package

For "how to" refer [Smoke tests README](../../smoke/cre/README.md)
