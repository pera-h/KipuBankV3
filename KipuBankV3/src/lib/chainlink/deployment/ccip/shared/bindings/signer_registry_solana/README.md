# IMPORTANT

Despite the majority of this code being autogenerated, manual intervention was necessary to work around issues in the bindings. If you intend to regenerate the bindings, remember to:

* Manually maintain the `program_id` to correspond to the one you intend to deploy.
* Ensure that instructions without arguments have their discriminator correctly serialized into the instruction data.
